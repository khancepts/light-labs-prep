		<div class="box">Hover here for some tasty transitions!</div>

        <p><strong>This meal is one of those solid go-to fixes</strong> when what I crave is more than just good eats, but also a romp amongst my childhood memories. As the scents and sounds of this cook up waft to thoughts of my dad stirring the pot, visions of <em>B.A. Baracus</em> and <em>Johnny Blaze</em> dance through my head. Originally my dad's concoction, consisting primarily of ground beef and peppers, it's evolved quite a bit to keep with the times. Just as hearty and flavourable, but now loaded with more nutrition, fibre, antioxidants and lean proteins. Instead of serving on pasta, it's more than satisfying to me in a hot bowl on its own or with a bun. Taste for yourself.

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a wide and deep pan, add enough coconut oil to coat the bottom once melted, and start browning the sausage on medium heat, turning often.</li>
            <li>Slice sausages only when able to cut them without them falling apart (usually after 5-6 minutes), then add peppers and ground turkey breast into the pan. Add 10-15 squirts of worcestershire sauce.</li>
            <li>Stir well and lower heat to low-medium. Add garlic and onion, stirring well. The meat should still be pink. Lower heat to low and let simmer.</li>
            <li>Add the remaining ingredients in the following order:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Broccoli tips</li>
                    <li>Grape tomatoes</li>
                    <li>Sliced mushrooms</li>
                    <li>Corn</li>
                    <li>One tbsp cayenne, one tbsp adobo, one tbsp salt</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Cover the pot, and simmer for 12-15 minutes, or until the broccoli is medium softness. Stir often, adding salt, pepper, and hot sauce to taste.</li>
        </ol>
		<h3>Other Notes</h3>
        <p>Adjust the recipe and ingredients as you see fit. You like beans? Throw some in. Into more exotic flavours? Sprinke some saffron or tumeric. The beauty about stews is you can totally customize the user experience. <em>Very <strong>user friendly</strong> indeed</em>.
